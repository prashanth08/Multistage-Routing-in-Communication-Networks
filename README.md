Multistage-Routing-in-Communication-Networks
============================================

Worked along with Prof Dr.Shalabh Bhatnagar to introduce a ‘Discrete Event Simulation Approach’ mechanism | Worked as a Project Trainee on a project on Routing in Communication Networks | Designed algorithm to generate discrete and continuous random variables | Implemented the M/M/c Queuing Theory with varying probabilities | Worked on Spall’s SPSA (Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation) algorithm. It is used to optimize systems with multiple unknown parameters using stochastic approximation.
